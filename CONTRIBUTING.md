# How to Contribute

Do you want to help make Laser Maze Game even better? These steps will guide you how you can contribute:

## Step 1: Fork the Repository
First things first, you need to fork the repository. This means you’ll make your own copy of the game so you can work on it without messing up the original.

1. Go to the Laser Maze Game GitHub page.
1. Click the Fork button in the top right corner. Now, you’ve got your own version of the game!

## Step 2: Clone Your Fork
Next, you need to clone your fork to your computer so you can start making changes.

1. On your forked repository page, click the Code button.
1. Copy the URL (it’ll look something like https://github.com/your-username/laser-maze-game.git).
1. Open your terminal (or command prompt) and type:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/laser-maze-game.git
    ```
    Replace `your-username` with your actual username
1. Navigate to the project directory:
```bash
cd laser-maze-game
```

## Step 3: Create a New Branch
Before you start making changes, create a new branch. This keeps your work organized and makes it easier to manage.

1. In the terminal, type:

    ```bash
    git checkout -b my-feature
    ```
Replace my-feature with a name but make sure it describes what you are working on.

## Step 4: Make Your Changes
Open the project in your favorite code editor and start coding. Add new levels, improve the game mechanics, or fix bugs.

## Step 5: Commit Your Changes
Once you are happy with your changes, it’s time to commit them.

1. In the terminal, type:

    ```bash
    git add .
    git commit -m "Add my feature"
    ```
   Replace `"Add my cool feature"` with a message that describes your changes.

## Step 6: Push Your Changes
Now, push your changes to your forked repository on GitHub.

1. In the terminal, type:

    ```bash
    git push origin my-feature
    ```

## Step 7: Create a Pull Request
Finally, it is time to share your work with the original project by creating a pull request.

1. Go to your forked repository on GitHub.
1. Click the Compare & pull request button.
1. Write a description of what you’ve done.
1. Click Create pull request.

And that’s it! Now the project maintainers can review your changes and, if everything looks good, they’ll merge your work into the main game. Congrats, you’ve just contributed to Laser Maze Game!
